a. ++ have higher priority than -
b. transplant variable in htif_t must mark with prefix "htif_", 
unless it's designed to replace the variable in sim_t


chip_config:
    #proc: cpu vector
        transfer from sim_t to htif_t
        overwritten by ++chip_config
        -p won't effect, please use ++
    #frequency:
        f_1000 ~ frequency = 1000MHZ(1000000000HZ)
    #xlen:
        pass, I don't know the difference between 
        xlen and rv(64) of string isa


rom write to different bus addr
    #bus_t only store a pointer
    #pc will directly point to that address, and exec step by step, so that need to write to the memory continuously


start_pc
    #should I change the state_t::reset's pc init value?
